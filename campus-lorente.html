                        <p>Sinag tams: I am very happy because of this. If I met many people, I feel that they are hard to talk to but they are kind, that's why sometimes many people fail in love because we are discouraged so you don't become the person you want to be, so now I will strengthen my heart when I really meet the one.</p>
